The program dependent MIPS are much lower than the non dependen ones.
It is caused by the programs utilizing the instrucitons nonevenely and thus
hitting the slower instructions more often.





The findings confirm that it's not a perfect measure since it is heavily
dependant on the utilization of the instrucions in a given program and in
some cases it can be much smaller than in the others as seen between the findings.

It also makes some architectures more favaorable even though the progrma execution
times might be actually the same on them, as seen in the findings.
